Key and mouse tracker, privacy guaranteed.

# Instructions

First make sure `Python3` is installed on your machine, and so are the following packages:

- `pynput`
- `numpy`

If they are not yet installed, install them using `pip3 install <package-name>`.

Then, in the project directory, run `python3 key_tracker_private.py`. Specify a save directory in CONFIG.py.
Otherwise, results will be stored 'outputs' and 'metadata' folders in the project directory.

Exit tracking with keyboard exception in the terminal any time.
